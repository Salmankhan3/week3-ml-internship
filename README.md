##  📘 Description
### In this repository i have documented task if week 3 of my machine learinig internship.I have implemented simple linear regression  purely in python,
make prediction method that predict new data and calculate R square manually.I have train multiple regression on claifornia hosuing data set and calculate mean absolute error (MAE), 
mean square error (MSE),root mean square error (RMSE) and r square score. In task 3.3 i have implemented Polynomail regression with different degree i.e 1,3,5 and 10. Plot actual value and regression line.
Plot all model on same graph to visualize underfitting and overfitting. In taks 3.4 I have trained plynomail regrssion and save model uisng pickle,joblib and json.Load the model and print file size and time for loading.
